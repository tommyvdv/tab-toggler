## 0.1.1 - Disable/enable Release

* Swapped toggling CSS classes with actual package toggling.
* Changes the keymap to `cmd-k cmd-i` by default. Seemed to make more sense considering 'window:focus-next-pane' and 'tree-view:toggle'.

## 0.1.0 - First Release

* Added a way to toggle the Atom tabs package visually. Added a basic spec test to explain it's behavior.
